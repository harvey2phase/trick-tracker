Welcome to Trick Tracker! This is an app that I am designing and developing to help me keep track of my skateboarding progression. When completed, this app will be used to store my photos and ratings for my skateboarding photos. Please enjoy and give feedbacks at Harvey.W@dal.ca, if you would like.

This is an incomplete implementation of Trick Tracker.

Instructions on testing the app:

   - Please run the app using Xcode in the Simulator or on an iOS device.
   - The entry view is an incomplete table view.
   - To access the add scene, please click the plus (+) button on the top right corner.
   - Click anywhere inside the "No Photo Selected" box to add photos from Photos.
   - Click on any star to fill all stars (inclusive) before it.

So far, the app only has two scenes:

   The table view, which is the entry view of the app, is designed to display tricks added by the user. Right now it can only display default entries, and the user cannot modify the entries.

   The add scene, where users can select photos from the Photo Library to be displayed in the app.

To do:

   - Implement add, edit, and delete functionalities.
   - Implement the cancel button on the add scene.
   - Fix star display issues on the table view.
