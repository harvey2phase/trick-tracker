Welcome to Trick Tracker! This is an app that I am developing to help me keep track of my skateboarding progrssion. As a skateboarder, I've always wanted something to organise and keep track of my tricks. When completed, this app will be used to store and display my photos and ratings.

Please enjoy and, if you would like, give feedbacks at Harvey.W@dal.ca

*This is an incomplete implementation of Trick Tracker*

Instructions on testing the app:
- Please run the app using Xcode in Simulator or on an iOS device (this app should be optimized for iPads).
- The entry view is the table view.
- Click the plus (+) button on the top right corner to access the add scene.
- Click anywhere inside the "No Photo Selected" box to add photos from Photos.
- Click on any star to fill all stars (inclusive) before it.


So far, the app only has two scenes:
1. The table view, which is the entry view of the app, is designed to display tricks added by the user. Right now it can only display default entries, and the user cannot modify the entries.
2. The add scene, where users can select photos from the Photo Library to be displayed in the app.


Known bugs/to do list:
- Implement the save and cancel buttons on the add scene.
- Allow scenes to be accessed from the table view
- Implement edit and delete functionalities.
- Fix star display issues on the table view.
